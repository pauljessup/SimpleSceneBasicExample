# simpleScene
An example game and scene editor using the Simple Scene Designer Lua library. Showing how easy it is to use, extend, and get running on making your own level/scene designer and then using that scene in your game.

Press escape to see the scene designer in action. Move the character using the arrow keys. The example uses a very rudimentary collision detection set up and sprite animation setup. These are not a part of Scene Designer, but instead something that shows you what can be done. For a more complex game, using something like Box2d would be better. The same with animations, something like Anim8 might be better.
